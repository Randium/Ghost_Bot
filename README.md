# Ghost_Bot

This is my first bot ever; the Ghost Bot. It's a bot that allows the dead players of the Werewolves game to still have some fun with the game, even though they technically no longer participate.

All you need to run the program is to have Python 3 installed, and have the Discord package installed. If everything is set up, simply start the batch file, or open a termin and run the main.py file.
